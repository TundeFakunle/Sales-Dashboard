Project Summary: Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard to analyze sales performance and drive data-informed decisions. The dashboard provides insights into total sales, profit, and quantities sold, with visualizations for trends and seasonal patterns. Key features include identifying top- and bottom-performing products, regions, and categories, as well as a map visualization for geographical analysis.

Time-series charts enable users to track sales trends over months and years, while dynamic filters allow tailored analysis by region, category, product, or time period. Data was modeled and cleaned to ensure accuracy and performance, with DAX formulas used for advanced metrics like profit margins and total sales.

The project enhances decision-making by providing actionable insights, improving visibility into sales trends, and automating reporting processes. It demonstrates the value of Power BI in simplifying complex datasets into intuitive, user-friendly visualizations.
